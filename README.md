DT (Decision Tree) & SVM (Support Vector Machine) are supervised machine learning classification algorithms.
GridSearchCV has been used to perform suitable hyperparameter tuning so that we get the best model built on both the algorithms.
Keeping in view the target variable for this dataset i.e customers, precision score (an evaluation parameter) becomes our top most priority and we need to ensure its highest value as per the problem statement.
Adequate care has been taken off during data cleaning process by maintaining the order of the ordinal data so that the machine generates meaningful productive insights and does not give false insights/impressions.
